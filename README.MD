# ChickenShedder v1.0 
### ChickenShedder is a Bukkit plugin that makes chicken shed feather whenever they lay eggs.

ChickenShedder.java is the main entry point of the plugin.
ChickenShedderListener.java is the main class that deals with the feather drop mechanics.
ChickenShedder projet was developped using Maven integration in IntelliJ Ultimate IDE

The code in the listener is heavily inspired by https://github.com/Pwn9/PwnChickenLay plugin.

Planned feature in ChickenShedder v1.1 : 
1. Get feather quantity from config yml file so users can determine how many feathers chicken drops. Right now it drops between 1 to 3 feather each time a chicken lays egg.
